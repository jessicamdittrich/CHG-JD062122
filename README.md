# Employee Tracker

## Objective
The objective of this application was to create a functioning employee tracker using npm inquirer, and mysql. By doing so, the user would be able to input their departments, roles, and employees, track them and make any necessary updates to an employee's role.

## Approach
My approach was to use what I learned during the in class activities to set up the files accordingly. I listed out the departments, roles, and theoretical employees and created a database to hold the information. I used Mysql Workbench to confirm all information was correct before inputting into the Javascript file to avoid any confusion. Then I added in the questions using an Inquirer prompt and determined that a switch statement would be of great use to allow the corresponding function to run questions depending on what the user selected. After that all I had to do was write my functions and perform minor troubleshooting.
