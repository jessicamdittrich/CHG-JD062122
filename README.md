# Employee Tracker

## Objective
The objective of this application was to create a functioning employee tracker using npm inquirer, and mysql. By doing so, the user would be able to input their departments, roles, and employees, track them and make any necessary updates to an employee's role.

## Approach
My approach was to use what I learned during the in class activities to set up the files accordingly. I listed out the departments, roles, and theoretical employees and created a database to hold the information. I used Mysql Workbench to confirm all information was correct before inputting into the Javascript file to avoid any confusion. Then I added in the questions using an Inquirer prompt and determined that a switch statement would be of great use to allow the corresponding function to run questions depending on what the user selected. After that all I had to do was write my functions and perform minor troubleshooting.

## End Result
The end result is an unfinished application but I am happy that I was able to complete the majority of the requirements. In a time crunch, I was able to code in the users ability to view departments, roles, and employees, as well as add a department.

## Reflection
After completing what I could for this project, I did my usual self reflection. I really struggled with adding roles and employees to the point where I lost track and ran out of time. I will definitely tackle this on in the future to complete the application but for now, with the time given, I am happy with the outcome and what I was able to accomplish.
